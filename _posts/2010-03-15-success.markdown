Thought I'd try a little bloggin' and this here is where I thought I'd do it. When I get time I'll add more blog-like features to this site but I'm working from the principles of The Simplest Possible Thing That Works and YAGNI so they won't happen until I want them to.

I'd like to keep this blog fairly general and post about my travels, photography, singing and dancing and work related stuff. I'll probably use it as a dumping ground for things I want to remember as well but I'll tag those up and hide them away.
